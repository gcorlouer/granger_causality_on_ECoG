In this script we visualise the subjects' ECoG electrodes. We first read ECoG raw channels
and visuasile all electrodes positions on a 3D brain obtained from averaging
patients scans with FreeSurfer's fsaverage function. 

Note: I cannot manage to plot with MNE, I think because it requires a trans.fif
file that I do not have. It seems that I do not have the right format to plot
the electrodes on a 3d surface. Maybe it is not too difficult to take the .mat
SUMA freesurfer files that I have but I have no idea how to do it. Oh, well.

I recommand using matlab to visualise electrodes on 3d brain.
